## Introduction

This Api provides Weather data for predefined locations. The data is harvested every minute
from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) and stored in a database.

It serves as a personal hobby project. The goal is to investigate and practice Api-design with Spring-Boot.
The OpenApi specification is documented with Redoc. [https://api.oskar-westmeijer.com](https://api.oskar-westmeijer.com)

In addition, a ReactJs frontend is available. It displays the weather data in charts over
time. [https://ui.oskar-westmeijer.com](https://ui.oskar-westmeijer.com)

### Technologies used

This repository contains the frontend and backend service. In production the backend connects to the hosts PostgreSQL database.
Proxy routing to these services is handled by another private proxy service.

```
- Java, Maven & Spring-Boot
- Spring Data JPA & Liquibase 
- Lombok, Mapstruct & OpenApi Generator 
- PostgreSQL, Testcontainers, Wiremock & Prometheus
- Nginx & ReactJS
- Github Actions, Docker and Docker-Compose
```

## Local development

### Build & test

This projects uses testcontainers. It will automatically inject the required resources to the started containers.

```
./mvnw clean verify
```

### Run application

Docker-compose initializes the dependencies on startup. There will be no connections to actual production systems.
Wiremock mocks the OpenWeatherApi requests. Use the correct docker-compose template!

```
docker-compose up -d
./mvnw spring-boot:run 
```

## OpenApi Generator

This project uses OpenApi code-generator. The Controller interfaces, external web client and response models are generated at compile phase
from this file ``

### Server Generator

The Server-Api specification file is located here `src/main/resources/public/weather-api.yml`. This project uses Redoc for Api documentation
purposes, after startup reachable on these urls.

- http://localhost:8080
- https://api.oskar-westmeijer.com

### Client Genearator

The client OpenApi specification is internal only and therefore located in a separate
directory `src/main/resources/openapi/openweatherapi.yml`. Webflux is used as
client library.

## Deployment

### Release image

The image will be released by Github actions. Merging into main will trigger a build & release.

## Documentation

A c4-model container diagram describes the architecture.
