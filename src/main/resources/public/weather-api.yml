    # Introduction
    This Api provides Weather data for predefined locations. The data is harvested every minute
    from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) and stored in a database.
    
    It serves as a personal hobby project. The goal is to investigate and practice Api-design with Spring-Boot.
    The OpenApi specification is documented with Redoc. [https://api.oskar-westmeijer.com](https://api.oskar-westmeijer.com)
    
    In addition, a ReactJs frontend is available. It displays the weather data in charts over
    time. [https://ui.oskar-westmeijer.com](https://ui.oskar-westmeijer.com)
    
    This project has no commercial intentions and is free to access for everyone.
