    # Introduction
    This Api provides Weather data for predetermined locations. The data is harvested every minute from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/).
    
    This application serves as a personal hobby project. The goal is to investigate and practice Api-design with Spring-Boot.
    Please have a look at the Github repository [https://github.com/OskarWestmeijer/weather-api](https://github.com/OskarWestmeijer/weather-api).
    In addition a ReactJs frontend is available. It displays the weather data in charts over time. [https://ui.oskar-westmeijer.com](https://ui.oskar-westmeijer.com)
    
    This project has no commercial intentions and is free to access for everyone.
